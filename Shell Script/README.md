In this repository, you'll find a code snippet written in shell scripting that I created to streamline the processing of command-line arguments. The function defined in the code allows displaying informative messages based on the specified parameters.

Code Features:
- A function named "a" has been crafted to handle command-line arguments.
- The script employs a loop to parse the provided parameters.
- Using the "-a" parameter triggers a customized message along with arguments starting from the second one.
- The "-b" parameter also triggers a similar informative message.
- This code proves useful in situations where you want to convey specific messages based on the used arguments.
